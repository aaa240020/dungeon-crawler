# Top Down Dungeon Crawler
For this project, I want to see I am capable of making playable game with differing paths in pygame, mainly because that is what's currently fresh in my mind

I want to recreate a classic nintendo game in order to incapsulate the simplicity and surprising longevity of the original games. I was going to, originally, make a simple platformer, just like the Mario games, but because of the abundance of online tutorials and resources available for recreating it, I decided to recreate the original legend of zelda game. 

My goal for this project is to make a dungeon crawler game that has collectibles and enemies to serve as a parody of the very first legend of zelda game created in the 1980s.

## Features
**Currency** - I want my game to have a currency system that the player can collect when defeating a certain type of enemy.

**Shop** - I want the player to be able to buy new *buffs*, to upgrade their <ins>health</ins>, <ins>speed</ins>, <ins>a revive</ins>, and etc.

**Weapons** - I want my game to have multiple weapons with differing attributes, like <ins>attack power</ins> and <ins>durability</ins>, and the attributes increase depending on the difficulty of the room.

**Repair Shop** - I want the player to be able to *replenish* their <ins>health</ins> and/or <ins>durability of their weapon</ins> (This shop will be in the same menu as the shop from before).

**Boss** - I want my game to have an ending. It'll be a boss that the player can access from the beginning of the game but'll be too weak to defeat. After they defeat the boss, blocking the exit, then they win the game
## Challenges
For my game to work, and function properly, I would need to develop a baseline understanding on how video game A.I. works to make functioning and difficult enemies to defeat.

I would also need to learn how to make walls/collisions that the player object won't be able to walk through, and especially different room for the player to explore.
## Outcomes
### <ins>Ideal Outcome</ins>
I hope that my game will be able to provide an *enjoyable* gaming experience. I hope to make it as enjoyable, if not even better, than the original legend of zelda game.
### <ins>Minimal Viable Outcome</ins>
Out of all the features that I've mentioned above, I left a few out. If I'm not able to add all the features I want, I at least want my game to provide the following.

**Multiple Room** - I want my game to have more than one room that the player can navigate around, at least 3.

**Collectibles** - I want my game to have collectibles that the player can obtain after *defeating* a room with their own attributes, like <ins>attack power</ins> and <ins>durability</ins>.

**Enemies** - I want my game to have enemies for the player to defeat, and even if the enemy doesn't move, I want there to be some sort of danger and/or difficulty for the player to face.

**An Ending** - I want my game to have an ending even if I'm not able to make a final boss, which will be an exit doorway after completely defeating a few rooms.

**Playability** - Most importantly, I want my game to a least function properly, like a real game
## Milestones
My goal is to complete at least 3 of the items listed above by the end of every week.

For example, by the end of week 1, I want the game to be playable, have collectibles, and have multiple rooms. And I would finish the rest for the following week.

With that pace, the minimum requirement for the game that I set for myself would be done in less than 2 weeks. This will give me, only a short time to finish any of the extra features that I wanted for the game (e.g. Currency, A Final Boss, A Shop, and Different Weapons).
